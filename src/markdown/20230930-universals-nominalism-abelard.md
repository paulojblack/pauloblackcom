In Medieval Western Europe, Neoplatonist metaphysics underpinned theology and philosophy. This had tangible consequences
for Medieval ethics, conception of self, historiography, hagiography and day to day life. Shortly before the
introduction of Latin translations of Aristotle, a remarkable philosopher took Neoplatonism to task and suffered
for his impiety.

## Universals

Metaphysics from the early to high Middle Ages was by and large Neoplatonist in that the material world was considered
to be populated by imperfect instantiations of metaphysical Forms. For example, this horse named Brunellus (a name
commonly used in Medieval philosophy as a placeholder for an entity, like Alice and Bob are used today) is a shadow
of the Form of “Horse”. When I look at this tree or that tree, each of which have its own individual characteristics,
branch growth patterns, bark texture, heights etc. I am actually looking at deviations from the ultimate, perfect true
“Tree”, which is unknowable to me through my senses. 

These Forms, the true “Tree”, true “Horse”, true “Human” are called Universals and what’s striking about this
designation is that these Forms are considered real, existentially manifest things. The horse Brunellus is not real, he
is a poor imitation of Horse, which I, in my fallen state in this world, cannot know. Even more strikingly… I am not
real! Neither are you, as we are both fallen, imperfect imitations of Human. From Bertrand Russell's chapter on Plotinus
in *The History of Western Philosophy* p. 284:

"*...the world of practical affairs seemed to offer no hope, and only the Other World seemed worthy of allegiance. To
the Christian, the Other World was the Kingdom of Heaven, to be enjoyed after death; to the Platonist, it was the
eternal world of ideas, the real world as opposed to that of illusory appearance.*"

"Illusory appearance" is the key phrase here. Predating modern analytical philosophers' rigor in defining what it means
to be "real" through harrowing semantic and logical methods and continental phenomenology like Heidegger's "facticity",
what is real or not was often described in terms of beauty or illusion. In either case, the physical, sensible world was
categorically less beautiful and more illusory than the various "truer" planes or essences of existence from which it
was derived.

Several volumes of thought and reflection were devoted to developing this framework between the 9th and 12th centuries and many monks endured countless wrist cramps in developing competing ideas on the details, but I think this simple description by and large captures the big picture. One can see how this fits in pretty cleanly to Medieval Christian ideology. Consider [Nietzsche’s True World Theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/#WillPowe) which categorizes the Christian conception of the afterlife and the Platonic concept of Forms as the same thing - an explanation (a nihilistic explanation, Nietzsche would argue) of the vagaries and misery of life built on the assertion that we live in a fallen, or not-real world and that the perfect world without all these woes awaits “after”. 

The point is that medieval thought was steeped in this Neoplatonist philosophy of Universals. I’m not real, you’re not real, that tree, that horse, your shoes, your sadness, your pain, your love - none of these things are real. In fact, they are to be dismissed categorically as distractions from the ultimate reality that awaits, comprised of Universal and sublime concepts: the Universal Love, the Universal Horse, the Universal Shoe etc. that we will access in the next - True - life.

All somewhat abstract so far, but what historian Norman Cantor identifies as a practical consequence of this was startling. *No one
wrote autobiographies*. Furthermore, to the extent that biographies of any kind were written of any noteworthy
individual, the author would tailor the story to conform to archetypes such as Saint or King. From p. 331 of
The Civilization of the Middle Ages:

"*Augustine’s Confessions was the last autobiography written before the twelfth century, and even it is not strictly an
autobiography, for the bishop of Hippo was concerned with revealing himself only as Everyman. In the early Middle Ages
there was little biographical writing worthy of the name. A mass of hagiographical literature followed conventional
patterns, forcing its subjects into preconceived molds and turning them into plaster saints. Kings were generally
portrayed by their secretaries in accordance with the ideal pattern of a Christian monarch set down in the prototype
Life of Constantine by Eusebius of Caesarea. When the characteristics of a real personality did break through in these
royal biographies, it was the result of a failure in artistic consistency; the writer was unable to sustain his
typological motif.*"

Considering the extent this attitude prevailed amongst the ecclesiastical class, one wonders about the average person’s
conception of themselves as an individual with idiosyncrasies worth acknowledging. Individualism saturates contemporary
attitudes towards personality to a degree that renders the early Medieval sense of self inaccessible. It's impossible to
know how much this negation of the importance of the individual, conveyed through history exclusively in the written
output of ecumenical staff, represents the attitude of the illiterate peasant that comprised the majority of European
demography. Nevertheless, this depriorization of the self must have left its mark, to some degree, on the lived
experience of Medieval notion of selfhood.


## Nominalism

Enter Peter Abelard (1079-1142) who, to whatever extent he is well known today, is most remembered as one half of the tragic romance of Abelard and Heloise. Arrogant, academically combative and with a habit of establishing competing lectures as soon as he had finished a teacher’s lecture series, he was not well liked by his peers and was naturally excommunicated and castrated for his intellectual insolence and dalliances with Heloise respectively. He was, however, a “genius of the first rank” as well as possessing of a charisma that, in this nascent, pre-university period of academia, was necessary to attract and retain a student following. Philosophically, he is best known for advancing Aristotelian logic to its furthest extent in Medieval Europe until the distribution of Averroes’ and Avicenna’s translations of the larger Aristotelian corpus that had not been preserved in the West through the Early Middle Ages. Moreover, though not the originator of the position called Nominalism that stands in stark opposition to Neoplatonist metaphysics, he is considered it’s greatest early proponent. I like the comment in his [Stanford Encyclopedia page](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abelard/#Met) that states “he devoted a great deal of effort to pouring cold water on the metaphysical excesses of his predecessors and contemporaries”.

In brief, nominalism asserts that Horse, Tree, Love and so on are not metaphysically factual *things* per se, but rather
*nomen* - names. Semantically useful labels with which we generalize the factual, or real, instances of those “Universals”
which themselves do not exist. This inverts the Neoplatonist position, arguing that sensory perception of tangible
materials and events are real and our semantic categorization of those materials and events into classes is a
construction with no basis in reality other the human (or divine) intellect. It was one of Abelard’s teachers,
eventually adversary, Roscellinus who was the first to put this position forward in clear terms, but in an incomplete
and unrigorous fashion that left him open to punishment from both his contemporary Anselm and his successor Abelard. In
reading about Roscellinus I found a source asserting that Roscellinus is the “forefather of modernity” on the grounds
that he originated the challenge to medieval Neoplatonist Realism. Like sainthood, that title gets handed around to
pretty much everybody.

Abelard put into practice the novel emphasis on the reality of the specific by writing an autobiography that
foreshadowed the idiosyncratic and deeply personal focus of Boccaccio, Petrarch and other giants of the Italian
Renaissance.*Historia Calamitatum* or The Story of My Calamities details Abelard’s genuinely calamitous, tragic life
during which he was castrated as an adult by the uncle of his lover, Heloise, and excommunicated and persecuted for his
philosophical/theological iconoclasm of which Nominalism is only one example. This was the first autobiography created,
or at least distributed, since Augustine’s *Confessions* eight centuries earlier.

Beyond becoming the “forefather of autobiographers”, Abelard’s dismissal of universals and focus on the individual bled into other domains of philosophy and theology. He, alongside Heloise, developed an ethical framework that accounted for the intention of the actor in determining the moral value of an act. This had practical ramifications for everyday people; he argued that infants who died before baptism were not doomed to an eternity in hell (a controversial claim) and developed an early concept of the insanity defense, arguing that an insane before acts without reason or intention as it is conventionally understood.
