This year's solstice came during a week of gray, gloomy rain in Virginia. The American Robin who always comes to hunt
for bugs outside my office window has been drenched (but undeterred from snacking) for a solid week, there's puddles all over the garden where I got
sloppy with the path-digging, and I feel able to forgive myself for dumping several hours into Diablo IV with some
friends instead of doing something more... useful. 

With the rain, however, came the very first little hint of the harvest we're expecting from the garden we've poured so
much love and energy into over the last several months. We got a phenomenally late start actually getting anything into
the ground since we only started transforming an 800 sq. ft. patch of grass into a fenced, double dug, fertilized,
composted and limed set of 8 34 ft. beds around March this year. In fact, two beds remain un-tilled as the 2 cycle
tiller that my father in law gifted me decided it no longer wanted to keep it's starter pull cord attached right as I
was about to finish the last beds! So 1/4 of the garden still looks like it's been visited by a gigantic mole.

I'm hoping we'll have enough harvest to preserve dozens or hundreds of tomatoes, peppers and squash through the winter -
but right now Julia and I are celebrating the very first Sungold cherry tomato we split alongside a big 5oz bowl of
spicy Tatsoi. From the strong taste, I am feeling great that we did a good job with the soil amendments. Everything is
cruising along for a bumper crop, but I've got one hand around a bottle of neem oil and the other holding on to a bag of
diatomaceous earth because I expect the aphids and slugs and all the other thieves to come crawling out of ground and
sky and get to munching on our tasty snacks once this rain clears up (if that ever happens).
