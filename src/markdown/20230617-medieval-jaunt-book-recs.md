To cut right to the chase:

[The Early Middle Ages - Philip
Daileader](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2062351.The_Early_Middle_Ages?ref=nav_sb_ss_2_15)  

[The Pillars of the Earth - Ken Follet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5043.The_Pillars_of_the_Earth)  

[A Distant Mirror - Barbara Tuchman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/568236.A_Distant_Mirror)  


I'd like to write more about these individually, and I hopefully will, but for the time being I want to recommend
this trio that between them covers the entirety of the middle ages.

### Early Middle Ages
As a book recommendation, The Early Middle Ages is sort of cheating as it's a Great Courses lecture series by Philip Daileader, a professor at my alma mater
William and Mary. Incidentally, watching these lectures (he has more on the High and Late Middle Ages) is what first put
that school on my radar, though I eventually majored in physics and never attended a single one of Daileader's lectures.
Daileader is an incredibly good lecturer - funny, a little dramatic, and clear. The arrangement of the material is
straightforward, a chronological survey from pre-Christian late Rome through the nationalization of Christianity, the
splitting of Rome and repeated sacking and dissolution of the Western Empire by the Ostrogoths, the long stories of the Merovingian and
the Carolingian dynasties closing out with the development of nations into roughly what they are today.

### Pillars of the Earth
Which opens the door to The Pillars of the Earth, a historical fiction novel ranked 33rd best loved book in the UK by
the BBC, produced into a TV show and a video game. The epic novel is set in the 12th century and follows the lives of several characters
who end up being minor participants in major historical events such as The Anarchy, the invention of mechanized fulling,
development of what came to be emblematic features of medieval masonry and architectural techniques and the assassination of
Thomas Becket. Is it a spoiler if it's history? Most of the book centers its drama around the attempt over the course of
a lifetime to build the greatest cathedral the world has seen for the monastery at the fictional English town of Kingsbridge, presided over by Prior
Phillip, an extremely lovable protagonist.

I have a huge sweet spot in my heart for what I call monastic fiction: Anathem by Neal Stephenson, A Canticle
for Leibowitz by Walter Miller and even the Redwall series are some of my favorite books. That said, I don't think I'm
so partial to a tonsure and the drama of simony that I can't recognize a truly great story, regardless of my papal
predilection. I plan to write more critically about The Kingsbridge series in general (did I mention this is book 1 of
3? All of them being 1000+ pages?), but for now let's skip to the end of the story following the assassination of the
Archbishop and shaming of Henry II at the end of the 12th century. Fast forward through one more century of territorial warfare,
simony, indulgences-for-sale, and nobility being obssessed with hawks as the second millenium "I just bought this drone
and I am going to ruin a lot of people's time at the park with it", and we come to:

### A Distant Mirror
A Distant Mirror - The Calamitous 14th Century. Bad ass subtitle first of all, and it's not exaggeration. This one is
nonfiction and it is terrifically written. Tuchman builds high drama out of the quarrels of English and French nobility
and royalty, mostly over land and pride, over the beginning of the 14th century as she sets the stage for the story.
She employs a technique I love which involves frequently dipping down beneath the clouds of the macro-political saga and
chivalric drama and blue-blood deviousness to survey a swath of the experience of - to quote Cornell West quoting Sly
Stone - Every Day People.

Even before we get to the truly devastating bulk of the book, Tuchman doesn't romanticize the
experience of a medieval peasant; she thinks it probably really sucked. The picture she paints of life as a peasant, a
Jew, a woman, even a nobleman - essentially everyone except a corrupt member of the Church - is relentlessly bleak,
filled with suffering, relieved only by the promise of a Better World After This One by an ecclesiastical community
whose credibility is in the process of being shattered.

Then the Black Death hits, and through the words of contemporaries including Boccacio, Petrarch, lone monks left in a
monastery of formerly 100+, and graffiti, Tuchman drives home the despair that gripped every soul in Europe
with certainty that they were experiencing God's apocalyptic wrath and a cleansing of the human race as their loved ones
erupted into miasmas of fetid buboe discharge. I'm sure there were "worse" times on earth for populations of similar
sizes, but this seems like at least a contender for first place. The story is morbid, but it is fascinating and it serves to set the emotional
and demographic tone of the 50 years of the 14th century that follow, written with a focus on the life of
Enguerrand VII of Coucy.

All of these are page turners; give one a shot.
