These two are often confused when pursuing "assistance from a more senior/experienced person" but can often be two
totally separate things that you may need from two (or more!) different people. In any event, its worth your while to be
intentional about which you are pursuing, and from whom.

Sponsorship is, in a nutshell, help getting [in the room](https://lethain.com/getting-in-the-room/) where decisions are
made. Mentorship is help developing the qualities and skills that will make you valuable enough to be sponsored (among
many other things, of course). 

**Mentorship** should be focused on substantive personal growth, and the people you look to for help in this should simply
be well developed in the traits or skills you want to grow. There's also some degree of altruism, or maybe
paying-it-forward, in a mentor/mentee relationship. It's nice if you can find a way to be useful to someone who is
helping you grow, but chances are you will be extracting more from the relationship than you are giving. And that's
fine, since your mentor probably experienced someone doing the same for them before and one day you'll donate your time
accordingly and so on. 

Finding mentorship is not that hard, most people are eager to teach and share their wisdom
especially if you approach them with the right disposition and perform your willingness to learn. The
challenge is in finding the right person to learn from.

**Sponsorship**, on the other hand, is much more of a transactional relationship. Generally somebody will
expend their social capital or exert their influence to bring you into a room if they believe that 1) You can make them
look good 2) You can further an initiative they think is important or 3) You can take work off their plate. The usual social factors weigh in, e.g.
someone is more likely to sponsor you if they like you or you have a friendly relationship. These are trickier
relationships to find in my
experience and it pays to be very direct with a prospective sponsor and let them know exactly what you are looking for
and what you have to offer. 

Personally, I have found more value out of the "sponsorship" model of relationship than the "mentorship" one. For one,
the feedback mechanism is very clear. Are you in the room yet? No? Then you are falling short in some way and need to
identify what needs improvement. Moreover, getting in a room is ultimately just the first step - you also need to stay
in the room and then of course effect the change you care about seeing by influencing or leading the room. These are
difficult things to do, and the best way to learn how to do them is to thrust yourself into a tricky situation and fail.
