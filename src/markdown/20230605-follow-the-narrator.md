I've usually got at least one physical book and one audiobook running at the same time but I tend to restrict the scope
of what I'll listen to to a much narrower set than what I'd read. I'm sure this is not uncommon, as the reduced
"reading" comprehension and ease of getting distracted multitasking while listening prevents everyone except people in
the fourth jhƒÅna from being able to pay sufficient attention to heady enough literature.

Anyway, one thing I've found opens up a lot of books for me is when I find a narrator who reads several similar (or
dissimilar!) books I can avoid the initial "new book/narrator" slog and the accompanying rewinding of the book every few
minutes because I've zoned out. Most recently, that's been [John Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rafter_Lee),
whom I found after picking up [Revelation Space](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/89187).

Incidentally, I went out
and bought a physical copy of Revelation Space after struggling with the audiobook at first due to an overwhelming
amount of characters paired with context switches defined by paragraph breaks that were tough to track aurally. I read
through the series - loved it - and after a year or so decided to jump back in to the Revelation Space universe with
the Prefect books also narrated by John Lee. This time I was hooked and ended up listening to every book in the RS
universe, all of which are narrated by John.

There's a lot of things that make John Lee a great narrator in my opinion, but two jump out at me. First, he is a good actor
and brings a lot of emotional range to the stories, enhancing the characters and the drama beyond what I think I'd get
from reading it myself. Second, and this is almost silly but somehow important to me, he just doesn't do anything
strange while he narrates.

He doesn't mispronounce things, he doesn't turn into Nick Mullen when there's a Chinese
character and he doesn't introduce strange flourishes like the narrator of The Expanse series who couldn't say
"Rocinante" without rolling the R for a few seconds.

Happily, John Lee narrates a host of other books that have either been on my backlog or that are happy discoveries. I
just finished [Perdido Street Station](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68494.Perdido_Street_Station) and have gotten
started on the first book of the Kingsbridge series, [The Pillars of the
Earth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5043.The_Pillars_of_the_Earth) which, so far, I can hardly put down. 

There's
plenty left too, with The Count of Monte Cristo and several (all?) books in Peter F Hamilton's Commonwealth Saga being
narrated by John Lee as well! If you feel really brave, I found he's also narrated Kant's Fundamental Principles of the
Metaphysics of Morals, which I think is probably worth going with a physical copy over no matter how good the narrator
is.

If you get frustrated with the "onboarding" time to a new audiobook and narrator, try sticking with one reader for a few
different books, maybe even across genres. And if you do try that, you might as well go with John Lee.
