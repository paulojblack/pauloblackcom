T posts and fishing wire! We're building an 800 sq. ft. garden and needed to keep the deer out. About $100 worth of T
posts (8 of them), a $30 T post pounder and $4 of fishing line took care of it easily. Don't skimp on the post pounder,
getting these things into the ground (especially the hard, packed, Albermarle clay) is exhausting and you don't want to
deal with hammering them in with a mallet.

You run the fishing line across the T posts in spans of 10-15ft, with each line being about a hands breadth apart from
the lines next to it. The idea is that the deer can't see the line, so they bump into it, get spooked and don't bother
trying to jump over it as they can't be confident how high up this invisible barrier goes. My posts ended up being at
pretty varying heights relative to one another, due to the hilly ground, so I started the lines from the top of the
lower T post, and continued running them every hand's breadth until I hit the ground.

You'll slice your fingers a little bit while you tighten the fishing line across the posts - you need to make it as taut
as possible because the line will relax in time and lose some tension. I've seen people suggesting doing things like
winding the line around a nail attached to a post to "wear down" the line before affixing it permanently, but that seems
unnecessary.

Furthermore, I suggest keeping lines between adjoining T posts. If you have three T posts in a sequence making up one side of your fence—T posts A, B, and C, with B in the middle—it's better to run one line from A to B and a separate line from B to C. This is a better approach than running a single line from A to C and passing over B. Maintaining tension over such a long distance can be challenging, and dividing it into smaller segments also makes it easier to adjust or correct any mistakes. For example, you might decide to move one of your T posts.

As for how to attach the line, friction is your friend. I didn't go with anything fancy, just wrapped the end of each
line around the post a few times, tied a [timber hitch](https://www.animatedknots.com/timber-hitch-knot) and a few
[surgeons knots](https://www.netknots.com/fishing_knots/surgeons-knot) until I felt satisfied then moved on. There's definitely a more efficient way to do this, but I'm usually
content to let a mindless activity occupy my hands if I'm working outdoors and listening to an audiobook.

The piece we vacillated about the most was definitely the gate. After wasting some money on gimmicky T post fixtures
most of which seem to be intended for hanging low farm gates for livestock, we went with a crude but effective solve. We
grabbed a bamboo shaft and some 7 foot deer net cut into a 4 foot length (for the width of our gate), wrapped one side
of the deer net around a T post and the other tied with twine through holes drilled periodically into the bamboo. Drive
a few inches of the bamboo into the ground and tie it to the opposite T post with some garden wire or twine and you're
good to go.

We don't have all that much in the ground yet, but we've got lots of tomatoes in. I see deer around the yard most days
and have yet to see any hoof prints or bite marks in the garden, so I feel pretty good about the efficacy of this style
of fence! Now we just need to figure out how to keep the moles out...
