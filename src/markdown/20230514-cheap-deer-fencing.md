T posts and fishing wire! We're building an 800 sq. ft. garden and needed to keep the deer out. About $100 worth of T
posts (8 of them), a $30 T post pounder and $4 of fishing line took care of it easily. Don't skimp on the post pounder,
it is well worth it. 

You run the fishing line across the T Posts in spans of 10-15ft, with each line being about a hands breadth apart from
the lines next to it. The idea is that the deer can't see the line, so they bump into it, get spooked and don't bother
trying to jump over it as they can't be confident how high up this invisible barrier goes.
