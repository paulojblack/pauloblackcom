"How do you handle a low performer" is a very common interview question for engineering management positions, and any
other kind of management I would imagine. I see three contexts that can change the way I would answer that:

1) The interview setting
2) HR guidance and bureaucratic/legal formalities
3) Actually trying to help someone

Of course all three are related and worth considering in their own right, but I want to focus on #3 as that is the
scenario least fit to be formalized into a clear process or set of statements. I am a mid level engineering manager, so
that's the lens I'm going to focus on. As a line manager, you'll likely be managing early/mid career, certainly non
executive reports and the style, bluntness and cadence of your feedback should be commensurate with the experience,
resilience and confidence of the recipient.

It can be awkward, uncomfortable and vulnerable to candidly tell someone *in a way that
resonates with them* what they need to improve to rise in your esteem. Much easier to fill out several negative
performance reviews and stress them out by mentioning "I've noticed a decline in your velocity over the last
several sprints" with nothing more to add. Don't be that kind of manager. Here's a listicle to help:

## You owe your reports your criticism
I've worked with and under managers who gleefully dish out put-downs and criticisms at the earliest opportunity. This
isn't for them. I think this is an important message for servant leaders, empathetic managers who love the role because
of the opportunity to improve people's lives. Part of improving people's lives is to help them challenge
themselves, grow and be better equipped for the future.

## Giving someone critical feedback and getting them fired are not the same thing

This cuts both ways: if you genuinely want to help a report improve and you choose to follow an HR generated performance
feedback process that isn't tailored to the individual while keeping your fingers crossed, you probably won't help them.
On the other hand, if you pour
your heart and soul into helping someone but reach the point where they need to be let go, if you haven't been following
the protocol set out by your HR department or executive leadership, chances are you may need to "start the process over"
and produce the paper trail necessary to part ways. This depends on how bureaucratic your organization is of course.
Famously, some orgs will just *make* you fire your low performers periodically - but some of them will tolerate
anti-productive staff sticking around for months or years out of organizational inertia.

I want to be clear, I'm not advocating that you put together a manifesto detailing every shortcoming of a report the
second you feel the need to bring them constructive feedback. I'm arguing that it's important to be aware of the
difference between your and the report's personal efforts to improve the situation, and the social and bureaucratic
reality of what's involved in firing someone *if things ever come to that point*.

## Avoid criticising # hours worked and other easily disputable topics

## Criticize outcomes, not efforts

## Connect everything back to their personal motivations

## Don't overwhelm them with criticism


## Don't be disappointed when they don't become your highest performer overnight
