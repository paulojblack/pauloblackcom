# README

This site was created for fun and relaxation as opposed to being a show-off piece with 103% test coverage and
intuitive directory structure. So to speak, enter at your own peril.


### TODOs
- Get the images out of the repo, store on an image server CDN
- Set up google analytics
- Rebuild the CSS without all the inherited gatsby stuff
- Less janky server setup
- Make it responsive (lmao as if)
- Write an about page
